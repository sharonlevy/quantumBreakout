QuantumBreakout
===============


Game Description
----------------
In QuantumBreakout, you attempt to keep a ball on the screen as it multiplies by passing through a beam splitter (One ball
will bounce off as the other passes through). Passing through the beam splitter makes the balls more transparent. If the original ball goes off the screen you lose. However, losing any of 
the other balls collapses some of the balls together but keeps you in the game. To keep the balls from leaving the screen 
you block them with a paddle at the bottom which you control with your finger. Scoring, levels, and winning conditions 
will be determined after user testing to maximize the fun! :)

Edge Cases
----------
Different collision possibilities including hitting the edge of the beam splitter.

Features To Be Added Later
--------------------------
* Landscape mode: more points
* Collapse all balls down to one (lose points?)
* Optional music
* Bricks
* Themed levels

Design Questions
----------------
* Alternative visual indicators of split balls (Change colors? Outline balls?)
* Start page/game description
* Ending page (score?)
